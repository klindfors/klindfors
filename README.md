## 🌄 Hi, I'm Kim!
I thrive in the intersection of technical development and design thinking. I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science and Software Engineering at Stockholm University, through which I have built a strong foundation in Human Computer Interaction and Interaction Design, as well as proficiency in Java, Kotlin, Python, Dart, C#, C++.
